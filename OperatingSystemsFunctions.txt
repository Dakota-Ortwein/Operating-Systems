The device manager is the portion of the operating system that interfaces with hardware devices. These devices can range from a monitor to an external hard drive. This also includes the computer's hard disks.
The memory manager is in charge of the silicone and RAM memory in a computer. This is not the data and files written on a disk. That is handled by the file manager.
